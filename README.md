# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
As a disclaimer I am still working through what looks like to be an issue I am having with some missing data as compared to the solution set.

As I suspected from personal experience, most of PyBer's total rides come from Urban cities. Generally, Urban demand was the only city type that was outpaced by the percentage of drivers in each city. Based on general suppy and dammand relationships, this caused the average price of fares for SubUrban and Urban cities to inflate compared to Urban cities.   

One of the largest disparities that we see comes in SubUrban cities where demand is almost 10% higher than the supply for drivers compared to Urban and Rural counterparts. This trend is roughly the same for Rural setting in which due to the lack of drivers, average fares are much higher. 

Summarizing the challenge data from February through April we can see some interesting trends. The first trend I noticed is the spike in fares during Valentine's day seems to be highest in SubUrban and Rural cities as opposed to Urban cities. There also seems to be a siginificant spike in fares for Urban cities during the beginning of March and there is a small spike in fares for rural cities in mid January and early February. I would love to research some more information about events in the area to see if that plays a significant role in people's choice to use rideshare. 

## Summary

Overall, the data suggests overall ride-share trends that follow what most would probably assume about different kinds of cities. If I were to make business reccomendations based off of the PyBer data sets it would be the following:

1. PyBer should look into incentives for drivers to relocate into taking more rural and suburban fares. The supply for drivers is currently outpaced by demand for rides and therefor drivers should eb able to capitilize on higher fares and more than likely longer distances to travel. 
2. I would invest more time and efforts into the data surrounding average distance of rides in each type of city. This data could be used to Develope a strong algorythm like PyBer's competetors have to optimize driver efficiency. You could also be  able to assist in redirecting and rerouting drivers to more suburban areas where is a lot more demand for drivers compared to urban areas.
3. Based off of supply and demand trends PyBer could experiment with promotions to boost rider engagement in Urban areas where demand is outpaced by supply of drivers.
